INSTALL
=======

Easiest way is to download all the files from repository and hack away :)

but if you want just the gallery, not the example stuff, here is how you do it:

1) Download "tiny-simple-image-gallery.js"
2) Create your HTML file (copy&paste essantial parts from example.html)
3) Create your own XML image gallery document (again... check the example_gallery.xml)
4) Remember to set config values from XML document to suit your own needs (directories)
5) Copy your images
6) Voila! It should work! :)


TIPS & TRICKS
=============

    If you are not sure, if your XML document is ok, open it with Firefox.
    If there is a problem, Firefox will give you good pointers about the problems in document.

    If you want to test this before installing it into webserver, this gallery will work offline without any webservers, 
    just download the files and double-click "example.html".
